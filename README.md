## About This Project

This project was born out of a passion for the fundamentals of Computer Science. The goal was to go beyond theory and to see, in a visual and interactive way, how sorting algorithms actually work by comparing their different approaches and efficiencies.

The application generates a random array of values and allows the user to select an algorithm to visualize its sorting process step-by-step.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch every swap and comparison the algorithm makes.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implementation of several classic sorting algorithms for comparison.
- **Interactive Controls:** (If you have them) Pause, reset, and adjust the visualization speed.
- **Data Generation:** Create new random datasets with a single click.

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- *(Add or remove algorithms as needed)*
