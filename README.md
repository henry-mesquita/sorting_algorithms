## About This Project

This project was born out of a passion for the fundamentals of Computer Science. The goal was to go beyond theory and to see, in a visual and interactive way, how sorting algorithms actually work by comparing their different approaches and efficiencies.

The application generates a random array of values and allows the user to select an algorithm to visualize its sorting process step-by-step.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch every swap and comparison the algorithm makes.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implementation of several classic sorting algorithms for comparison (in process).

---

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- More will be implemented in the future.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Graphics Library:** pygame, pygame-gui
